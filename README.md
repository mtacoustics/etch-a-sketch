# etch-a-sketch

The goal for this project is to create a etch-a-sketch like app/site using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Goals:
-commit WAY more.
     I did good on my RPS project when coding the JS portion then when I went to html I got so focused I commited only twice..
-Clean code
-Build a clean GUI
    simple, clean, themed.
-Don't go above and beyond. Do the project requirments and that is it.
    for the rps project I made it difficult on myself by trying to go above and past.
    Keyword KISS : Keep it simple stupid.
-Log todos in my README file and update frequently.

Todo's:
